- Just adding for now. No saving (too early in the course).
- Went really well. Feels like javascript is becoming very natural now
- Just need to work on problem solving & when to use functions

- Today was another good day. Ran into a small problem with the remove button, I'm hoping to sort that.
- Again, feeling in a very good place with it.
